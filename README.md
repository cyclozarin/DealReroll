# DealReroll
Due to hard-coded generation of pickable sponsorships in `SurfaceNetworkHandler.NewWeek` method that happens only once on run 1 (2nd quota), when you complete/fail a sponsorship, **sponsors will forget about you and will never send you even a single sponsorship.**
However, there is a way to regenereate them through modifying game's save file, but this mod not only automatically fixes problem with disposable sponsorship generation, it makes it much more convinient. All you need to do is just **install this mod if you're a host**.
